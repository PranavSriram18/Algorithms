"""
This code is based on a problem posed by Daniel Litt (@littmath) on X.
Below is an adapted version of the problem.

Flip 100 coins, labeled 0 through 99. Alice checks the coins in order 
(0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦) while Bob checks the even-labeled coins, then the odd-labeled 
ones (so 0, 2, 4, ..., 98, 1, 3, 5, ..., 99). Who is more likely to see two 
heads (not necessarily consecutive) *first*?

Our implementation generalizes the game to n coins, with t heads required to 
win, and with coins landing on heads with probability p.
