# Algorithms
Implementation of various algorithms and data structures, and solutions to algorithmic puzzles.

This is a work in progress.

Directory overview:

experiments: Simulations and experiments, mostly related to some interesting math
problem (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations to understand the behavior of some random process).

fourier: Implementations of some common signal processing transforms, like DCT, DFT, FFT, etc.

graphs: Common graph data structures (like UnionFind), and solutions to several Leetcode-style problems
involving graphs and graph theory.

low_level: Problems on bit manipulation, linked lists, pointers, etc.

misc: Other code that doesn't fit neatly into the other categories.,

parsing: Problems involving strings, expressions, and parsing.

permutations: Problems involving permutations.

recursion: Problems involving recurrences in various forms (standard recursion,
dynamic programming, DFS, topological sorting, divide & conquer, etc.)

trees: Data structures and problems involving trees and their applications (BSTs, heaps, dynamic 
programming on trees, etc.)

utils: Utility functions for use elsewhere in the codebase.
