# Algorithms
Implementation of various classical algorithms and data structures, and 
solutions to algorithmic puzzles. Many of the puzzles come from popular
algorithmic programming websites like Leetcode and Hackerrank, while others are
inspired by posts on various math and programming forums and communities.
Header files generally contain context on the source of a given algorithm,
data structure, or problem.

This is a work in progress.

**Directory overview**
combinatorics: Problems involving permutations, combinations, subsets,
enumeration, and other combinatorial structures.

concurrency: Algorithms and constructs involving multithreading and/or
    concurrency control, e.g. solutions to the Dining Philosophers problem.

dp_and_recursion: Problems involving recursive structure in various forms (
    standard recursion, dynamic programming, DFS, topological sorting, divide & conquer, etc.)

design: Data structure design and simulation problems.

experiments: Simulations and experiments, mostly related to some interesting 
    math problem (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations to understand the behavior of some random process).

games: Problems involving combinatorial games.

geometry: Problems involving (usually 2D) geometry.

fourier: Implementations of some common signal processing transforms, like DCT, 
    DFT, FFT, etc.

graphs: Common graph data structures (like UnionFind), and solutions to several 
    algorithmic problems involving techniques related to graphs (BFS, shortest
    paths, etc.)

linear structures: Problems involving reasoning about linear structures (like 
    arrays). Concepts/techniques include two-pointers, prefix sums, sliding 
    windows, rolling hashes, etc.

low_level: Problems dealing with low-level manipulation of bits, pointers, and 
    memory.

misc: Other code that doesn't fit neatly into the other categories.

number_theory: Problems related to number theory, e.g. primality testing, 
    residues, etc.

parsing: Problems involving strings, expressions, and parsing.

python_basics: Basic exercises for getting up to speed with Python.

strings: String processing algorithms and data structures.

trees: Data structures and problems involving trees and their applications 
    (BSTs, heaps, dynamic programming on trees, etc.)

utils: Utility functions for use elsewhere in the codebase.
